# Contract Grades – “A” Contract

I, Yoo Ri Hwang, agree to :

1.  Earn “Satisfactory” on 11 self-paced lab assignments on the schedule
    specified below.
    -   Satisfactory defined:
    -   I have attempted all steps of the assignment. If unable to
        complete steps due to unresolved questions, I have asked
        questions in Github FAQs or zoom help session, or I have Googled
        the issue and shown effort to resolve questions;
    -   I have checked that forked files, repos, or projects appear on
        my Github account and are accessible;
    -   I feel like I have spent an adequate amount of time and energy
        on assignments;
        <!-- (tentatively defining “adequate” based on Lab 1 and previous experience with R: I will spend at least 30 minutes on labs and at least 1 hour on portfolio pieces); -->
    -   My unessays are organized, thoughtful, and free of grammar
        mistakes or typos;
    -   My presentation is professional and engaging.
2.  Produce at least 10 “Satisfactory” portfolio pieces on the schedule
    specified below.
3.  Complete two “Satisfactory” Unessays on the schedule specified
    below.
4.  Complete a “Satisfactory” presentation based on the strongest of the
    two unessays. 10 minutes total in length.
